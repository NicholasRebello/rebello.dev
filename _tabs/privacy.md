## Your Privacy is Important
I believe users have the right to know what data of theirs is being collected by the websites they visit. I am committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. I have no interest in any of your personal information. Instead I actually encourage you to use browser plugins such as [uBlockOrigin](https://ublockorigin.com/), [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/), and [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) to help minimize the amount of information your computer gives up.

Remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

As a reminder, you don't need to have something to hide to care about your privacy.

## Cloudflare DNS
Rebello.dev utilize's [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) as it's DNS. They describe visitors of their customer's websites as "End Users". Pertinent parts of its privacy ploicy state:

>"Cloudflare processes End Users’ interactions with Customer’s Internet Properties and the Services. This information is processed when End Users access or use our Customers’ domains, websites, APIs, applications, devices, end points, and networks that use one or more of our Services, and when End Users access or use Services, such as Cloudflare Zero Trust. The information processed may include but is not limited to IP addresses, traffic routing data, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from Customers’ websites, devices, applications, and/or networks.The End User data that we make available to our Customers via the Service dashboard or other online interface are specifically defined as “Customer Logs”.
>Cloudflare may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers, Administrators, and End Users. For example, we may assemble data to determine how Web crawlers index the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity or to compile web traffic reports and statistics. Non-personally identifiable, aggregated data may be shared with third parties."
