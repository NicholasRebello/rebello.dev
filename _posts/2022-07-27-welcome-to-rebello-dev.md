Welcome to rebello.dev, a GitHub Pages site where I intend on documenting my progress in the cybersecurity/network administration field. The main intention for this is for me to learn a little bit about basic web development, show off any projects I may be working on, and hopefully teach some stuff I learn along the way. The posts more or less will be informal in nature. It has been a long time since I've had any formal education in writing, so I plan on making these as if they were diary entries.

I originally created the foundation for this site late in 2021 while I was on deployment. Credit to [Simon Dosda's blog](https://simondosda.github.io/posts/2021-09-13-blog-github-pages-1-introduction.html) for showing me the first steps in setting it up. Didn't have a ton of time to work on it then, and since being back on land I have been a little sidetracked with the normality of civilian life while back on shore. As I am getting closer to ending my time with the Navy I have decided to pick the project back up, and hopefully will be able to contribute to it on a more frequent basis.

My first real post after this one will be about how I studied for CompTIA Network+ N10-008 and passed it on the first try. I understand that this certification isn't really much to write home about, but it is the first IT cert I've obtained, and I just wanted to go over the few tools I used that helped me obtain it.

I'll also be attending DEFCON 30 this year, which will be the first DEFCON that I have ever attended. I'm not really sure what to expect, but I'm hoping to learn a lot and meet some cool people. I intend on making a post about my experience at the conclusion of that trip.

I have also started to dabble in "Home Labbing", so I plan on making a series of posts covering all sorts of topics related to that. How I've set mine up, what sort of VMs/Dockers I'm currently using, etc.

As a closing note; I really don't expect this site to get much traffic at all, if any at all. My intentions currently aren't to try to pull in a lot of people and develop a sort of audience. I have no intentions on serving ads. I don't want to collect information on people visiting. I just want fun little project to learn (If you look at my commit history you can see that I have no idea what I'm doing).

Until next time,

Rebello
